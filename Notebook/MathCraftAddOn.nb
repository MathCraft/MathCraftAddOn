   "\"\<INTRODUCTION. When on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was \
much struck \nwith certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of \
South America, and in the geological \nrelations of the present to the past \
inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light \
on the origin of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by \
one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, \nin \
1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently \
accumulating and \nreflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have \
any bearing on it. After five years' \nwork I allowed myself to speculate on \
the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged \nin 1844 into a \
sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period \
to \nthe present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I \
may be excused for entering \non these personal details, as I give them to \
show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision. \nMy work is now \
nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete \
it, \nand as my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this \
Abstract. I have more \nspecially been induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, \
who is now studying the natural history of \nthe Malay archipelago, has \
arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have \non the \
origin of species. Last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a \
request \nthat I would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the \
Linnean Society, and it is \npublished in the third volume of the Journal of \
that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker, \nwho both knew of my work--the \
latter having read my sketch of 1844--honoured me by thinking \nit advisable \
to publish, with Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my \
manuscripts.\>\""}], ";"}], "\n",
